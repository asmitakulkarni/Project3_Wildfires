# Project3 Visa Rejection

H1B Visa - Reject or Accept?
 
I am looking at the visa applications from 2018 to see if I can classify the conditions under which someone's visa is accepted versus rejected.
Every year there are thousands of applications made to the Immigration Services regarding work authorization (commonly known as H1B visa). Every few years,  changing policies have the companies and employees on their toes trying to guess why some applications get rejected.
 
I found a dataset on Kaggle which is sourced from the Dept of Labor website. I am also looking to download some data from Crunchbase on the employer information to use as features to create classes
 
This is my approach in creating a classification model that makes a picture of what factors are associated with an application getting accepted or rejected
